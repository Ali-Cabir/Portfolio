### About me
I’m a Game Programming graduate from George Brown College with a passion for building and testing interactive experiences. Currently working as a curriculum developer, I’m shifting my focus toward QA, where I can combine my technical background and attention to detail to ensure high-quality software. I also work at George Brown College as a curriculum developer, assisting in the creation and QA testing of first-person simulation experiences used to train students and new employees. I’ve also collaborated on a 2D platformer project featuring a momentum-based grapple mechanic, focusing on gameplay systems, design, and testing. These experiences have strengthened my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail, which I am now applying toward a dedicated career in QA.
