## About me
I’m a Game Programming graduate from George Brown College with a passion for building and testing interactive experiences. Currently working as a curriculum developer, I focus on QA for first-person training simulations while transitioning toward a dedicated QA career. I’ve also collaborated on a 2D platformer featuring a momentum-based grapple mechanic, contributing to gameplay systems, design, and testing. These experiences have strengthened my technical skills, problem-solving, and attention to detail—qualities I’m eager to apply in QA.

## Projects
### 1. To-Do List Application (Manual Testing)

### 2. Postman API Testing (Trello API)
Tested Trello’s REST API using Postman by sending and validating requests for boards, lists, and cards. Created and executed positive and negative test cases, validated JSON responses and status codes, and documented results to ensure endpoint reliability.
