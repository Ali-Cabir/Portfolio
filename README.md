## About me
Iâ€™m a Game Programming graduate from George Brown College with a passion for building and testing interactive experiences. Currently working as a curriculum developer, I focus on QA for first-person training simulations while transitioning toward a dedicated QA career. Iâ€™ve also collaborated on a 2D platformer featuring a momentum-based grapple mechanic, contributing to gameplay systems, design, and testing. These experiences have strengthened my technical skills, problem-solving, and attention to detailâ€”qualities Iâ€™m eager to apply in QA.

## Projects
