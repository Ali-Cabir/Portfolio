## About me
I’m a Game Programming graduate from George Brown College with a passion for building and testing interactive experiences. Currently working as a curriculum developer, I focus on QA for first-person training simulations while transitioning toward a dedicated QA career. I’ve also collaborated on a 2D platformer featuring a momentum-based grapple mechanic, contributing to gameplay systems, design, and testing. These experiences have strengthened my technical skills, problem-solving, and attention to detail—qualities I’m eager to apply in QA.
